# Task Hints Authoring Guidelines

When authoring this collection of hints, mark each hint with the double pound (##) markdown header and title the header with Task n, Hint n. Capital T and H. Tasks and Hints nymbers start at 1. See this [Challenge Hints](https://www.katacoda.community/challenges.html#ui-example) in the authoring guide on how to provide hints for your challenge scenarios. The [Katacoda markdown extensions](https://www.katacoda.community/scenario-syntax.html#katacoda-s-markdown-extensions) can be applied in this markdown. An optional horizontal divider (`---`) can be added before each Task section.
